# XVIZServer

This is a server to handle XVIZ hosting from multiple data sources.

The server operates by defining a middleware stack, and options will
control how that stack is structured and how requests and data are processed
through that stack.

The flow does try to preserve a no touch data flow, but does allow conversions
and eventually filtering of data.

This is stil a work in progress

# XVIZServer(session, opts)
# XVIZSession(factory)
  onConnection create SessionHandler if supported

# XVIZSessionHandler(socket, request, source, opts)
  construct middleware stack for request/opts

# XVIZServerMiddlewareStack
Server middleware models the client side middleware to support
a stack of handlers that will receive the `(request, msg)`.

*request* is the object of the original request from the client.
*msg* will be the current response if is is set.
 - *data is an XVIZData object

# XVIZ Data Format and encoding

XVIZ can be formatted a number of ways:
	- json
		string
		arraybuffer
	- glb
		arraybuffer

## args
  - port
  - d, multiple

  - live
    server data w/o 'start'
    remove metadate start/end time
    do not send done

  - scenario

  - loop
    serverresponse hook frame index calculation
    middleware change frame times

  - delay
    serverResponse

  - limit
    serverResponse

  - filterStream
    mw
  - filterType
    mw

  - validate
    validate request
    validate response

  - format json, json_arraybuffer, binary
    mw

XVIZSourceFactory
  list([path]): [ [available sources] ]
    // for all internal impls collect based on path
    // scenario would list everything it supports
  open([path], log_id): [ XVIZSource|null ]
